## üìã Requirements
Following are required for using CleverTap iOS SDK -
- iOS 9.0 or later
- tvOS 9.0 or later
- Xcode 10.0 or later

## üéâ Installation

### [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

For your iOS, App Extension target(s) and tvOS app, add the following to your Podfile:

  ```
  target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do  
      pod 'CleverTap-iOS-SDK'  
  end     
  ```

  If your main app is also a watchOS Host, and you wish to capture custom events from your watchOS app, add this:

  ```
  target 'YOUR_WATCH_EXTENSION_TARGET_NAME' do  
      pod 'CleverTapWatchOS'  
  end
  ```

  Also, you will need to enable the preprocessor macro via your Podfile by adding this post install hook:

  ```
  post_install do |installer_representation|
      installer_representation.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
          target.build_configurations.each do |config|
              config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= ['$(inherited)', 
              'CLEVERTAP_HOST_WATCHOS=1']
          end
     end
  end
  ```

Then run `pod install`.

### [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

CleverTap also supports `Carthage` to package your dependencies as a framework.

To integrate CleverTap into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "CleverTap/clevertap-ios-sdk"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `CleverTapSDK.framework` into your Xcode project.

Also, follow steps to link SDWebImage into your project
